\title{Count the number of fields in each line of a file}
\usage{
count_fields(file, tokenizer, skip = 0, n_max = -1L, encoding = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{Either a path to a file, a connection, or literal data
(either a single string or a raw vector).

Files ending in \code{.gz}, \code{.bz2}, \code{.xz}, or \code{.zip} will
be automatically uncompressed. Files starting with \code{http://},
\code{https://}, \code{ftp://}, or \code{ftps://} will be automatically
downloaded. Remote gz files can also be automatically downloaded and
decompressed.

Literal data is most useful for examples and tests. It must contain at
least one new line to be recognised as data (instead of a path) or be a
vector of greater than length 1.

Using a value of \code{\link[=clipboard]{clipboard()}} will read from the system clipboard.}

\item{tokenizer}{A tokenizer that specifies how to break the \code{file}
up into fields, e.g., \code{\link[=tokenizer_csv]{tokenizer_csv()}},
\code{\link[=tokenizer_fwf]{tokenizer_fwf()}}}

\item{skip}{Number of lines to skip before reading data.}

\item{n_max}{Optionally, maximum number of rows to count fields for.}

\item{encoding}{The text encoding of the data given in \code{file}. If \code{NULL} is
passed (the default), then "UTF-8" is used for files,
"bytes" is used for connections and raw vectors, and the
string Encoding will be used for literal data strings.}
